# PSSharp.Core.Tasks


## Synopsis
C# project for task-related processing for the PSSharp.Core module.

## Description
This project utilizes tasks in a more lightweight syntax than is possible with F# by using the C# task-based asynchronous
programming model supported by the C# compiler. The project also takes advantage of the dynamic syntax supported in C#
that is missing in F# to provide additional support for any types that are considered "task-like".
